# 📊 IBM Shell - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook focused on the **IBM Shell** dataset. The analysis explores trends, patterns, and insights from the data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To understand and visualize the trends and relationships in IBM Shell's stock performance by:
- Analyzing key metrics (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume)
- Identifying seasonal trends
- Exploring correlations
- Creating insightful visualizations

## 📁 Files

- `IBM_SHELL_EDA.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with complete data exploration and visualization.
- (Optional) `data.csv` — Source data used for the EDA (add your dataset if applicable).
- `README.md` — Project overview and setup guide.

## 📌 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-series visualization
- Correlation heatmaps
- Moving average analysis
- Distribution and trend plots
- Interactive visualizations (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (if used)

## 🚀 Getting Started
